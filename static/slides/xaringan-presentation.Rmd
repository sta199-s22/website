## Ninja presentations in R with `xaringan`

![](img/xaringan-hex.png)
---

# Hello World!

- The presentation is created using the [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package

- Click the `Knit` (to `moon_reader`) button to compile your presentation

- The output is an HTML file that you can open in your browser


---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Why xaringan?

```{r kakashi-sensei, echo=F, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/kakashi-sensei.jpg")
```
---

# xaringan

Building your presentation in R lets you:

- simplify slide creation with automatic arrangement

--

- include R plots seamlessly (say 'goodbye' to low resolution screenshots or messy exports/imports)

--

- ~~fix~~ edit all slides at once when you make a typo

--

- show off your slides to the world by putting the knitted HTML on your website 

--

- make slides interactive (e.g. html widgets)

--

- make beautiful equations with LaTeX:

--
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$
---

# Getting started

Use `---` to separate slides and `--` for incremental builds within a slide

--

Arrange the text in two columns:

.pull-left[
Here is the text in column 1 $^*$
]

.pull-right[
Here is the text in column 2

- Point 1
- Point 2
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

---

# Plots

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
                     y = species, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(color_palette$orange, 
                               color_palette$purple, 
                               color_palette$cyan))
```

---

# Tables

On this slide, we have summary statistics for the bill depth by species. 

```{r remove-missing}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
penguins_modified <- penguins %>%
  filter(!is.na(bill_depth_mm))
```

```{r plot-penguins2, echo = FALSE}
penguins_modified %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(bill_depth_mm), median = median(bill_depth_mm), 
            sd = sd(bill_depth_mm)) %>%
  kable(digits = 3)
```

---

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Here is some text
- Here is more text
]

.pull-right[
```{r barplot, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# out.width and fig.width changed from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(x = "Island", 
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Species", 
       title = "Distribution of species", 
       subtitle = "by island") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(color_palette$orange, 
                               color_palette$purple, 
                               color_palette$cyan))
```
]

---

# Adding images

```{r penguins, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Artwork by @allison_horst"}
include_graphics("img/penguins.png")
```

We can also make an image the full page.

---

background-image: url("img/penguins.png")

# Interactive data frame!

```{r df-ex, echo=F, warning=F}
penguins2 = penguins %>%
  select(species, island,
         bill_length_mm,
         bill_depth_mm)

DT::datatable(
  head(penguins2, 20),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```

# Presentation tips

- Be terse

--

- A picture's worth a thousand words

--

- Script the first two lines of your talk

--

- Number the slides in the corner

--

- Plan 1-2 minutes per slide

--

- Practice with a friend!
