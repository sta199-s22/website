"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device" - John Tukey

# Let's get started

First we will finish `ae02`. 

- Open RStudio, either locally or [in the online container](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers).
- Next, make sure `ae02` is your open project (check the upper right). If it is not, go to `File` $\rightarrow$ `Open Project` and select the `ae02-username.Rproj` file.
- If you did not create/open `ae02` in the last class, you will need to follow instructions to create the repo [here](https://sta199-sp22-003.netlify.app/appex/lecturenotes02.html) by finding the text that says "click here to clone a GitHub repo and make a new RStudio project" and then clone the project from the course GitHub page.

Next we will begin `ae03`. [Click here to create ae03](https://classroom.github.com/a/BwEOHRqy)

- Next, go to the course GitHub page and find `ae03-username` 
- Click the green "code" button and copy the `SSH` URL
- Go to RStudio, select `File` $\rightarrow$ `New Project` $\rightarrow$ `Version Control` $\rightarrow$ `Git` and paste the URL
- Open the `.Rmd` file
