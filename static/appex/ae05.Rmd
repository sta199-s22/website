```

## Tidy Principles

Tidy data has three related characteristics

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each value has its own cell.

Let's look at some examples!

## Data Wrangling

Often we need to wrangle our data to extract meaning. This includes calculating new variables, summary statistics, grouping by variables, renaming, reordering, selecting subsets of data, filtering by various conditions, etc.

We can accomplish a great deal of wrangling by learning just 
**seven key verbs**. Each of these functions takes a data frame as input and returns a data frame as output.

- filter
- arrange
- select
- slice
- mutate
- summarize
- group_by

To demonstrate data wrangling we will use a dataset of characteristics of all flights departing from New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013. If the library command does not work, you may need to install the package first using the commented line of code (note you only need to do this once, **only do it if the library command does not work**).

```{r load-flights-data}
#install.packages(nycflights13)
library(nycflights13)  
```

We first explore the data a bit. Examine the documentation as well.

```{r explore-data}
glimpse(flights)
names(flights)
head(flights)
```

The `head()` function returns "A tibble: 6 x 19" and then the first six rows of
the `flights` data. A **tibble** is a tweaked, opinionated version of the `R` data frame. 

There are a few differences a `tidyverse` tibble and an `R` data frame. Two of the main ones are described below.

First, it provides more information than a data frame. When you print a tibble, it will show the first ten rows and all of the columns that fit on the screen, along with the type of each column. Try this with the `flights` data. You can modify the number of rows and columns shown using the `print()` function.

1. **Question:** Can you print the first three rows and all columns of the 
`flights` data? Check the documentation!

```{r print}
```


Second, tibbles are somewhat more strict than data frames when it comes to 
subsetting data.

### `select()`

The `select()` function picks off one or more columns by name.

Let's say we want a dataset that only contains the variables `dep_delay` and
`arr_delay`.

```{r select-vars}
select(flights, dep_delay, arr_delay)
```

We can also use `select()` to exclude variables. Let's exclude `dep_delay` but
keep all other variables.

```{r exclude-vars}
select(flights, -dep_delay)
```

We can also use `select()` to select a range of variables. Here, we select the 
first three variables representing the departure day.

```{r include-range}
select(flights, year:day)
```

### `arrange()`

The `arrange()` function orders rows (observations) in specific ways. 

Let's arrange the data by descending departure delays, with large departure delays on top.

```{r arrange-delays-desc}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

Or with low departure delays on top.

```{r arrange-delays-asc}
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```

What if we only want to examine the `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns? We can combine `arrange()` and `select()`!

```{r select-and-arrange}
select(arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay)), dep_delay, arr_delay)
```

**It is not easy to understand what is going on in the code chunk above.**

- we have to read from inside out and right to left
- not clear which argument goes with which function
- doesn't focus on the functions

The pipe is a technique for passing information from one process to another. 

```{r pipe-demo}
flights %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay)
```

When reading code "in English", say "and then" whenever you see a pipe.

2. **Question:** How would you read the code chunk above in English? What is it accomplishing?

### `slice()`

Slice selects rows based on their position.

Here we slice off the first 5 rows of the `flights` data.

```{r slice}
flights %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

We can also slice the last two rows.

```{r last-two}
flights %>%
  slice((n()-1):n())
```

3. **Question:** What is the code chunk below accomplishing? Guess before running the code.

```{r arrange-slice}
flights %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

To add comments to code, use the pound sign. This is helpful for debugging as well - you can temporarily disable a line.

4. **Question:** What will happen if you comment out the line containing 
`arrange()` in the code chunk above? Try it.

### `filter()`

`filter()` selects rows satisfying certain conditions.

We can use a single condition. Here we select all rows where the destination
airport is RDU.

```{r rdu}
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "RDU")
```

We can use more than one condition. Here we select all rows where the 
destination airport is RDU and the arrival delay is less than 0.

```{r rdu-ontime}
flights %>%
  filter(dest == "RDU", arr_delay < 0)
```

More complex conditions are possible!

5. **Question:** In plain English, what is the code below accomplishing?

```{r nc-early}
flights %>%
  filter(dest %in% c("RDU", "GSO"),
         arr_delay < 0 | dep_delay < 0)
```

The table of logical operators below will be helpful as you work with filtering.

|operator | definition |
|:----------|:--------|
| `<` |   is less than? |
| `<=` |   is less than or equal to? |
| `>` |   is greater than? |
| `>=` |   is greater than or equal to? |
| `==` |   is exactly equal to? |
| `!=` |   is not equal to? |
| `is.na(x)` |   is x NA? |
| `!is.na(x)` |   is x not NA? |
| `x %in% y` |   is x in y? |
| `!(x %in% y)` |   is x not in y? |
| `x & y` |   is x AND y? |
| `x \| y` |   is x OR y? |
| `!x` |   is not x? |


The final three operators only makes sense if `x` is logical (TRUE / FALSE).

### `mutate()`

`mutate()` creates a new variable.

In the code chunk below, `air_time` is converted to hours, and a new variable
`mph` is created, corresponding to the miles per hour of the flight.

```{r calculate-mph}
flights %>%
  mutate(hours = air_time / 60,
         mph = distance / hours) %>%
  select(air_time, distance, hours, mph)
```

Using `<=` in the mutate creates a new variable `on_time` that is TRUE if the flight is on time and FALSE if it is not.

```{r calculate-ontime}
flights %>%
  mutate(on_time = arr_delay <= 0) %>%
  select(arr_delay, on_time)
```

6. **Question:** What do you think will happen if you take the mean of the 
`on_time` variable?

### `summarize()`

`summarize` calculates summary statistics. It collapses rows into summary 
statistics and removes columns irrelevant to the calculation.

Be sure to name your columns!

```{r find-mean-delay}
flights %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay))
```

7. **Question:** The code chunk above should return an NA. What is going wrong? Try to fix it to find the mean departure delay.

```{r find-mean-delay-no-na}
flights %>%
  summarize(prop_on_time = mean(arr_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### `group_by()`

`group_by()` is used for grouped operations. It's very powerful when paired with summarize to calculate summary statistics by group.

Here we find the proportion of flights that are on time for each month of the year.

```{r delays-by-month}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(prop_on_time = mean(arr_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We can calculate more than one summary statistic in `summarize()`. In addition to the proportion on time for each month, let's find the maximum delay, median delay, and the count of flights in each month.

Here `n()` calculates the current group size.

```{r summarize-by-month}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(prop_on_time = mean(arr_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_delay = max(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n())
```

Finally, let's see what the proportion on time is for EWR, JFK, and LGA.

```{r ontime-nyc}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(on_time = mean(dep_delay <= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### `count()`

`count` counts the unique values of one or more variables. It creates frequency tables.

```{r count}
flights %>%
  count(origin)
```

8. **Question:** What is the code chunk below doing?

```{r find-prop}
flights %>%
  count(origin) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

## Practice

(1) Create a new dataset that only contains flights that do not have a missing departure time. Include the columns `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, and `dep_delay_hours` (the departure delay in hours). Note you  may need to use `mutate()` to make one or more of these variables.

```{r practice-1}
```

(2) For each airplane (uniquely identified by `tailnum`), use a `group_by()` paired with `summarize()` to find the sample size, mean, and standard deviation of flight distances. Then, pick off the top 5 and bottom 5 airplanes in terms of mean distance traveled per flight.

```{r practice-2}
  
```
