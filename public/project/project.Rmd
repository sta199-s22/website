Project proposal due **Friday February 25**

Draft report due **Monday, March 28**

# Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data science 
techniques by conducting a novel analysis of a dataset of your own choosing
or creation. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data 
using a survey or by scraping the web.You will also get practice presenting your results.

# Brief project logistics

The final project will be done with your lab groups.

The five deliverables for the final project are

- A project proposal describing three datasets of interest
- A written, reproducible report using R Markdown detailing your analysis
- A GitHub repository corresponding to your report
- Slides + a group video presentation
- A formal peer review of another team's project

**Late projects will not be accepted without prior approval** As per the syllabus, you and your team must complete all components of the final project to pass the course.

The grade breakdown is as follows:

# Data Sources

To perform a successful analysis it is imperative that you choose a manageable
dataset that can be analyzed using the tools we have learned in STA 199. This 
means that the data should be readily accessible, not contain too many missing values, and be large enough so that multiple relationships can be explored.
Your dataset must have at **least 500 observations and at least ten variables 
(or has been approved by Prof. Fisher)**. The dataset should include a rich mix of categorical,
discrete numeric, and continuous numeric data. If you have any doubts or are
having trouble please reach out to me.

All analyses must be done in RStudio and your final written report and analysis must be reproducible. This means that you must create an R Markdown document attached to a GitHub repository that will create your written report exactly upon knitting.

If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered 
in class (for instance, a .DAT file), make sure that you are able to load it 
into RStudio as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are 
having trouble, google first, then ask for help.

Data sets that **cannot** be used:

- Data sets used as examples/homework in this class

- Data that has been analyzed in another class

- Kaggle

# Project components

## Project Proposal

The first stage of the final project is the project proposal. 

The proposal serves two purposes:

- to get you started early with reading and thinking about a dataset and the questions you want to answer

- to ensure that the data you wish to analyze, methods you plan to use, and the scope of your analyses are feasible and have maximize your chance of success

Choose **three** substantially different datasets you are interested in analyzing. For each, identify the components below.

### Introduction and Data

- Identify the source of the data

- When and how it was originally collected (by the curator, not necessarily how you found the data) 

- A brief description of the observations

### Research question

- Describe the research topic along with a concise statement of the research question and hypotheses.


### Data set

Use the `glimpse()` function to glimpse your data and include the output at the end of your proposal.

Place the file containing your data in the `data` folder of your project repo


### Submission

Order your proposals from first choice to third choice.

Submit the PDF of your proposal to Gradescope by **Friday February 25 at 11:59 PM**. I will provide feedback on your proposal and help you decide which dataset you should use for your final project.  Project proposals should have no more than one page of **text.** (With the `glimpse` data it is likely to go beyond a page total.)

The project proposal will be graded as follows:

Total                                                   | 5 pts
--------------------------------------------------------|-------
**Introduction/data**                                   | 2 pts
**Research questions**                                  | 2 pts
**Data glimpses**                                       | 1 pts

## Written report

Your final report must be written using R Markdown. All team members must contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits / pushes. Before you finalize your report, make sure the printing of code chunks is turned off with the option echo = FALSE.

Your final report must match your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are as follows, but feel free to expand with additional sections as necessary. Your final written report should not exceed ten pages inclusive of all
tables and figures.

The written report is worth 80 points, broken down as follows:

Total                                                   | 50 pts
--------------------------------------------------------|-------
**Introduction/data**                                   | 5 pts
**Methodology**                                         | 10 pts
**Results**                                             | 20 pts
**Discussion**                                          | 10 pts
**Formatting**                                          | 5 pts

#### Introduction and data

The introduction provides motivation and context for your research. Describe
your topic (citing sources) and provide a concise, clear statement of your 
research question and hypotheses.

Then identify the source of the data, when and how it was collected, the cases,
a general description of relevant variables.

#### Methodology 

The methodology section should include justification of the choice of 
statistical method(s) used to answer your research question. You can also include summary statistics relevant to preliminary analysis of your research question (if relevant).

#### Results 

Place figure(s) here to illustrate the main results from your analysis. 1 beautiful figure is worth more than several poorly formatted figures. You should **not** use the default gray background `ggplot` theme.

Showcase how you arrived at answers to your research question using the
techniques we have learned in class (and beyond, if you’re feeling adventurous).

Provide only the main results from your analysis. The goal is not to do an 
exhaustive data analysis (calculate every possible statistic and perform every possible procedure for all variables). Rather, you should demonstrate that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them using data, 
that you are skilled in interpreting and presenting results, and that you can 
accomplish these tasks using R. More is not better.

#### Discussion

This section is a conclusion and discussion. This will require a summary of
what you have learned about your research question along with statistical
arguments supporting your conclusions. You should critique your own methods 
and provide suggestions for improving your analysis and future work. Issues 
pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and the appropriateness of the statistical analyses should also be discussed. Also include a brief paragraph on what you would do differently if you were able to start over with 
the project.

### Formatting

Your project should be professionally formatted. For example, this means labeling graphs and figures, turning off code chunks, and using tidyverse style.

## Repository

In addition to your Gradescope submissions, we will be checking your GitHub
repository. The repos should be formatted in the same manner as labs with a data folder. This repository should have equal contribution by all team members and should include

- RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results)
that will output the proposal and write-up in one document
- Meaningful README file on the GitHub repository that contains a *codebook*
for relevant variables
- Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a `/data` folder)

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.
